XIAO-ESP32C3 Pump Board Examples

Here are a few examples to test the pump board (TODO: add link to design files).

## ON/OFF Test

The [pump_onoff_test](pump_onoff_test) is based on the basic blink example.

## ON/OFF WiFi

The [pump_onoff_wifi](pump_onoff_wifi) connects to a wifi network and has a REST API for turning the pump on and off.
